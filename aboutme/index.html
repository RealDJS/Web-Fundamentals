    <h2>Dennis Skoy</h2>
    <h3>DJ</h3>
    <p>My college major is CIT. I enjoy cinema, reading, music (except for rap, country, and death metal),
        video games, and ballroom/country dancing. I love getting to know my ward members and meeting
        new people in my classes.</p>
    <p>I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints for twenty years (since I was eight years
        old).</p>
    <p>I am here for school because I was offered a full-time education.</p>
